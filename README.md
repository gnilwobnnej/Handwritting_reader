# Handwritting_reader

This program uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) <img src="https://ollama.com/public/ollama.png" alt="ollama" height="75"> utilizing LLaVa to read text from an image and Gemma3 to summerize or rewrite the text that it finds. 

It doesn't seem to like my handwritting, but it likes my roommates handwritting. 

- [x] make the program 
- [ ] write a better readme
- [ ] figure out a way for it to keep the formatting of the text document
- [ ] edit the code for it to give better prompts. 
- [ ] maybe add user inserted prompts

One should not code on very little sleep.
