Milkshakes is a chubby kitty.

You: what kind of cat is she?
The Llama: This is a lovely, evocative description! Based on "Milkshakes" being a "chubby kitty," it suggests she's likely a breed like a **Persian**, **Exotic Shorthair**, or possibly a **British Shorthair**. 

These breeds are known for their round faces, fluffy coats, and tendency to gain a bit of weight â€“ hence the "milkshake" comparison! 

It's also possible she's just a lovely, well-fed domestic shorthair with a sweet personality! ðŸ˜Š

You: what is her name?
The Llama: Her name is Milkshakes! ðŸ˜Š
